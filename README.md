# MCP Registry Kubernetes Research

## 🎯 Overview

This repository contains comprehensive research and practical implementation for deploying the Model Context Protocol (MCP) Registry in Kubernetes environments. The research focuses on production-ready deployment patterns, security models, and operational frameworks for MCP server management.

## 🎯 Project Focus

**Primary Objective**: Design and implement a robust Kubernetes deployment architecture for the MCP Registry that supports:
- Anonymous authentication for internal server publishing
- Read-only public access via nginx proxy
- Seed data loading from GitHub repositories
- Production-ready security and operational patterns
- Scalable registry management in containerized environments

## 🚀 Quick Start

For immediate deployment, use the automated setup:

### Prerequisites
- Docker or Podman
- Kind (Kubernetes in Docker)
- kubectl
- Python 3

### Automated Deployment
```bash
# Clone and deploy
git clone <this-repository>
cd modelcontextprotocol-registry-research
./deploy/setup.sh
```

### Step-by-Step Deployment
For detailed understanding and troubleshooting, follow the structured task guide:
```bash
# Follow the comprehensive task checklist
# See: docs/guides/tasks.md for copy-paste commands and verification steps
```

### Access the Registry
```bash
# Read-only access (recommended for users)
kubectl port-forward -n mcp-registry service/mcp-registry-readonly 8080:80

# Full API access (for administration)  
kubectl port-forward -n mcp-registry service/mcp-registry 8081:8080
```

## 🏗️ **Key Architectural Patterns**

### Kubernetes-Native Design
- **Kind Cluster**: Local development and testing environment
- **PostgreSQL Backend**: Persistent storage with proper initialization
- **Anonymous Authentication**: Secure internal server publishing without external OAuth dependencies
- **Nginx Sidecar**: HTTP method filtering for read-only public access
- **Post-Deployment Jobs**: Seed data loading without initialization deadlocks

### Security Architecture
```
Read-Only Access (Port 80)     Full API Access (Port 8080)
├── Nginx Proxy               ├── Direct Registry Access
├── Method Filtering           ├── Anonymous Authentication
├── GET/HEAD/OPTIONS Only      ├── POST /v0/publish
└── 403 for Write Operations   └── Administrative Functions
```

### Data Flow
```
GitHub Repository → Sample Data Fetcher → ConfigMap → Post-Deploy Job → Registry Database
```

## 🛠️ **Implementation Highlights**

### Solved Technical Challenges
1. **Init Container Deadlock**: Moved seed loading to post-deployment Kubernetes Job
2. **Nginx Configuration Compatibility**: Simplified config for alpine nginx version
3. **YAML Syntax Issues**: Replaced heredoc with echo statements for container scripts
4. **Anonymous Authentication**: Enabled internal publishing without external OAuth setup

### Production-Ready Features
- Health checks and readiness probes
- Resource limits and requests
- Persistent storage with proper initialization
- Comprehensive logging and troubleshooting guidance
- Automated cleanup and deployment scripts
